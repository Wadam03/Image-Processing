# Image-Processing
Image processing to recognise whether an X-Ray of lungs has evidence of pneumonia or not.
There was a lot of parameter adjusting in this project, and my report outlines why I chose the parameter values that I have defined
in my code.

To run this project yourself, simply:
-Download the xray images folder and main.py
-run main.py, ensuring its one higher in the file architecture than the xray images
